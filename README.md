## Project Plan
Initially the group got together when the team was known after the first webinar. A repository was created and colaborators were adeed to allow different members to create their branches and work locally, as necessary.<br>
After this, a project board was also created on GitHubOn, the draft user stories were done with the help of MS Co-pilot.<br> 
Co-pilot provided sufficient and relevant user stories including the acceptance criteria and tasks required for each user story. <br>
Some adjustments had to be made, as the scope of some of the user stories didn't fit into the project timeframe.<br>

### User Stories
Here are all the user stories that have been prioritised for the current implementation of the site:
| User Stories                                    | MoSCoW priority           |  Status  |
| ----------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------:| --------:|
| Po                                              | must have                 |   Done   |



All user stories were logged on the [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/j0hanz/projects/8) on GitHub repo, along with the assessment criteria and expected performance for the Hackatho<br>
There were also prioritised as must-have, should-have and could-have.<br>
As well as using the Project Board to track progress on our project, we also used it during testing to log any significant bugs that need to be fixed before the project deadline.<br>

## Deployment

Heroku deployment process:
- This project uses Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:
- Select New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select Create App.
- From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars, and set your environment variables.
  - | Key | Value |
  - | --- | --- |
  - | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
  - | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
  - | `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
  - | `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
  - | `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
  - | `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
  - | `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
  - | `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
  - | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
  - | `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
  - | `USE_AWS` | True |
- Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.
  - requirements.txt
  - Procfile
  - runtime.txt
  - You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:
  - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
  - pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- The Procfile can be created with the following command:
  - echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
  - replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located
- The runtime.txt file needs to know which Python version you're using:
  - type: python3 --version in the terminal.
  - in the runtime.txt file, add your Python version:
    - python-3.9.19
- For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:
- Either:
  - Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app.
- Or:
  - In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
  - Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a app_name (replace app_name with your app name)
  - After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type:
    - git push heroku main
- The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!
